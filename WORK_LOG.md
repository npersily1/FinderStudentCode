| October 31 | 1100-1130 |                                                                     Implemented a polynomial rolling hash function. Found a random big prime in the millions. Decided to store strings at the arraylist |
| November 2 | 0245-0315 | Implemented reading the table. I make us of string.split() to get an array of strings then I add to the Arraylist at the hash of the key the string of the value. I will use linear search from then on |
