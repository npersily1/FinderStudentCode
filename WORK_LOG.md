| October 29 | 1245-115  |                                                                                  Classtime: learned what a hash map is. We broke down the problem into the core idea that we have to limit empty space. |

| October 31 | 1100-1130 |                                                                     Implemented a polynomial rolling hash function. Found a random big prime in the millions. Decided to store strings at the arraylist |
| November 2 | 0245-0315 | Implemented reading the table. I make us of string.split() to get an array of strings then I add to the Arraylist at the hash of the key the string of the value. I will use linear search from then on |
| November 3 | 0300-0330 |                    While implementing find, I realized that I had no real way to tell which slot in the list to look at if there was a collision. Right now I have it set to random object in the array |
