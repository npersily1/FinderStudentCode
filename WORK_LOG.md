We broke down the problem into the core idea that we have to limit empty space. |

The list is of p length |

Found a random big prime in the millions. Decided to store strings at the arraylist |

I make us of string.split() to get an array of strings then I add to the Arraylist at the hash of the key the string of the value. I will use linear search from then on |

Right now I have it set to random object in the array |
| November 5 | 0230-0300 | I created a hashmap class with instance variables ints(tablesize,count,radix,default_tablesize) and a map of private pair class which I created. I copy and pasted my hash method that was initially in finder here. I set up add so first it adds one to the number of keys that need to be inserted and then it checks for sizing. Finally,there is a while loop that starts checking at the map[hash of key] and adds 1 to the hash (mod by the end) until it finds a suitable cell. |

Put the pair at the new hash of the key of the current pair. I also implemented find. It works similarly to insert: while not at a null node check to see if at the hash of the key is the actual key. If yes return the value if no add 1 to the key and mod. At the end I return invalid key if nothing has been found. |

Created a hashmap instance variable and when I buildtable I just call add on the correct columns. I also fixed an error in resize. I wasn't dealing with collisions. I just implemented an altered add method for each key in the old map |

Then my code was correct but slow so I played around with my Radix's and Initial table size until I got a combo that worked. Now it runs in 2.2 seconds |

To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
